abstract = {How do people learn to make better decisions? The authors believe people use their experience to make better judgements and decisions, and that it is the accumulation and application of an experience base that is the key, rather than the use of more powerful strategies. If we are to provide meaningful training, we must understand the role of experience in decision making. In this paper the authors first examine the role of experience in classical models of judgement and decision making. Next they describe the role of experience in naturalistic decision models. They are particularly interested in the way people use their experience to handle time stress, ambiguous/incomplete and unreliable data, and ill-structured tasks. Finally, the authors present implications for training people to make better judgements and decisions.},

@article{Kim2014,
abstract = {Existing spoken dialogue systems are typically not designed to provide natural interaction since they impose a strict turn-taking regime in which a dialogue consists of interleaved system and user turns. To allow more responsive and natural interaction, this paper describes a system in which turn-taking decisions are taken at a more fine-grained micro-turn level. A decision-theoretic approach is then applied to optimise turntaking control. Inverse reinforcement learning is used to capture the complex but natural behaviours from human-human dialogues and optimise interaction without specifying a reward function manually. Using a corpus of human-human interaction, experiments show that IRL is able to learn an effective reward function which outperforms a comparable handcrafted policy.},

abstract = {Cover Samuelsonian Economics and the Twenty-First Century Edited by Michael Szenberg, Lall Ramrattan, and Aron A. Gottesman Description This volume illuminates and critically assesses Paul A. Samuelson's voluminous and groundbreaking contributions to the field of economics. The volume includes contributions from eminent scholars, including 6 Nobel Laureates, covering the extraordinary depth and breadth of Samuelson's contributions. Samuelson, the first American economist to win the Nobel prize in 1970, was the foremost voice in economics in the latter half of the 20th century. He single-handedly transformed the discipline by creating a new way of presenting economics, making it possible for it to be cast all in mathematical terms. Samuelson developed broad frameworks, such as the neoclassical synthesis, a mixed economy, and the surrogate production function, which provided practitioners with a vision for research. Samuelson's contributions to economics are rich, complex, consequential, and relevant to the ordinary economics of life. The quality of Samuelson's output and methods leave no doubt that his contributions continue to be timely and relevant even in the 21st century. Ideal as a reference or an introduction to Samuelson's work, this is a must-have for students and academics alike.},

@article{Train2003,
abstract = {This book describes the new generation of discrete choice methods, focusing on the many advances that are made possible by simulation. Researchers use these statistical methods to examine the choices that consumers, households, firms, and other agents make. Each of the major models is covered: logit, generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit, plus a variety of specifications that build on these basics. Simulation-assisted estimation procedures are investigated and compared, including maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and method of simulated scores. Procedures for drawing from densities are described, including variance reduction techniques such as anithetics and Halton draws. Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling. No other book incorporates all these fields, which have arisen in the past 20 years. The procedures are applicable in many fields, including energy, transportation, environmental studies, health, labor, and marketing.},

@article{Cho2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder--Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder--Decoder as an additional feature in the existing linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},
